## Hardware Setup

### RX5808 Video Receivers
Modify the rx5808 receivers to use SPI.

Remove the shield from the rx5808, the shield is normally held on by a few spots of solder around the edges. Use some solder wick to remove the solder and free the shield from the receiver. Be careful not to damage any ground pads on the receiver. There are usually small holes around the edge you can use to help push off the shield.

Remove the following resistor:

The shield should be soldered back in place after removing the resistor.

Note: the rx5808 bought via the above Banggood link already has the resistor removed. It doesn't hurt to double check a few.

### Step by step instructions

This is what we'll work towards. It is a 4 node set-up, but is easy to extend (with almost the exact same steps for an 8 node set-up).

Cut the female pin headers (to hold the Arduinos) to the appropriate length and solder them to the PCB

Adding resistors, the PCB indicates which goes where

Checking where the rx5808 module already has the spi mod (as described above)

Holding the rx5808 temporarily in place for easy soldering.

First rx5808 in place

All rx5808 in place, verified all contacts with multimeter

Adding male pin headers for connecting the Raspberry Pi, a second PCB, as well as for the polulus
![add some male pin headers](img/pcbv2/12_male_pin_headers.jpg)

Adding the XT60
![add xt60](img/pcbv2/13_xt60.jpg)

Adding a 3.3V polulu (left) for the rx5808 and a 5V polulu (right) for powering the Arduinos and Raspberry Pi. Note: in an 8-node setup the second PCB does not need polulus.

Close-up of how the polulus are floating above the resistors.

Added jumpers to power the Arduinos (remove jumpers if you want to update the software on the Arduino)

Plugging in the Arduinos. There is a [pdf guide on how to upload the software to the Arduinos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9OE5zhYmglkelZBYmFtZkROUWpmRVBySlNTcm8wSkRzT3lz/view).

Connections between Raspberry PI and PCB. Clone the [git repository](https://github.com/scottgchin/delta5_race_timer) on your Raspberry Pi or look at the resources post in https://www.facebook.com/groups/Delta5RaceTimer to download the latest SD card image of Delta 5.

Add an ethernet cable and plug it into your router.

To get from the 4-node to the 8-node system, repeat all the steps (except the polulus) on a second PCB. Then connect the six pin headers on the side of the first PCB to the corresponding pin headers on the second PCB.
